# Getting Started

The Nest framework contains an example Sass codebase, a library of Front-end patterns, a set of templates and additional documentation.

The latest version of the library is published on Github and uses KSS-node to generate the docs.

To use kss-node, download the repo and run `npm install` to install dependencies (requires Node,js and NPM).

It can then be run with the following line:

    npm-run kss --source sass --destination styleguide --css css/styles.css

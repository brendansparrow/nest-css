# Design Tokens

## What are design tokens?

Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design system. They define and have the greatest overall impact on the system as a whole. These can represent anything defined by design: a CSS font stack, a colour as an RGB value, a spacing unit expressed in ems, an opacity as a decimal number, an animation timing function as Bezier coordinates. Theyâ€™re used in place of hard-coded values to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences.

Design tokens are directly integrated into our component libraries and UI kits. They cover the various options of platform scales, colour themes, component states, and more.

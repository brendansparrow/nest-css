# Glossary

A helpful glossary of definitions so that everyone can approach the project on the same page in terms of the language we use to describe the system.

### Atomic Design

A modular approach to building interfaces, popuarised by Brad Frost.

### Design System

A collection of shared design patterns and practices that allow a team to build high-quality, consistent interfaces.

### Design Patterns

Repeating, reusable parts of the interface - a bit like a LEGO kit.

### Design Principles

These guiding principles dictate how we design our products the system works and how we create, organise and share those patterns.

### Elements

The primitive, building blocks of our system which mainly consist of undecorated HTML elements such as text elements, buttons and form inputs.

### Pattern Library

A website or application where deisng patterns are stored and documented. It allows a design team to use the shared

### Scales

Our typographic scale allows us to size design elements proportionally across different viewports. The Base Size determines the starting size for the scale, and the Scale Ratio determines the incremental change in hierarchy from size to size.

### Variant

A modified version of a design pattern.

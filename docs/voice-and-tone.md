# Voice and Tone

Our content standards will help you understand how to think strategically about the language in your products and apps. Theyâ€™ll also give you clear, tactical suggestions designed to help you use language to craft better experiences. Here are some writing principles to help you create the right voice and tone for your product.


## Content Guidelines

1. Be Concise

Text on the web should be clear and understandable. Respect your readers' time and keep your writing brief and to the point. Use headings and divide your text into short, scannable segments that focus on a limited number of concepts at a time. 

Good: Please sign up.
Bad: You must be registered in order to proceed.


2. Write for all reading levels

Part of writing clearly is making sure your writing can be understood. Use simple, direct language that makes content easy to understand. Keep your sentences short. Avoid jargon and avoid idioms or phrases with indirect meanings.


3. Watch your punctuation and grammar

While its okay to be informal, you should take care to use the correct grammar. Use the active voice to clarify the subject and the action. Don't mix your tenses or hop from first to second person.


4. Be consistent

Use consistent language to refer to the same action. Does your language match with the way your users think and the words they use? Identify synonyms (a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language), and eliminate them. Each important object and action should have a single word to represent it.

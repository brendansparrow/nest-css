# Motion Guidelines [WIP]

The rule of thumb is to communicate early and often, give teh user visual feedback when they interact with the page and to show the user that the system is busy. Users will feel in control if tehy are allowed to move at their own pace so animations should be interruptible and should also respect user preferences for reducing animations.

UI animations in this system follow the RAIL model.

RAIL - respond, animate, idle, load

Respond immediately to give instant feedback.
Animate the response for a smoother experience.
While the app is idle, provide distraction and ease tension.
Load the page early while animations are happening.

[WIP] More content coming soon.

# Design Principles [WIP]

These design principles guide all of our design decisions.

## 1. Design with compassion

Design things that understand and respect people's needs. Take the time to learn about the people you're building your product for.

## 2. Test your assumptions

Do not rely on hunches. Design and test your work with real people. Observe behaviour and gather evidence. Work with subject experts and existing research.


## 3. Be inclusive

Make sure your work is accessible to everyone, regardless of their race, age, gender, physical ability, cultural background or bank balance.


## 4. Do the hard work to make it simple 

Take the time to understand what you are trying to solve. Do not push complexity onto the people using what you are designing.

## 5. Work openly

Share your learning. Share your work. Be transparent in your design decisions.
